**Unit 1: Introduction to Financial Accounting** <span id="1"></span> 
*Suppose you are the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of a small business
in the restaurant industry and have been asked by key investors whether
the company is financially stable enough to expand to four new states. 
How would you go about determining this?  The answer is accounting! 
Accounting refers to the process of identifying, measuring, and
communicating financial information for sound economic
decision-making.*  
  
 *This unit will introduce you to fundamental accounting terms.  You
will learn how accounting informs company-wide decisions and how
information is communicated within a company and beyond.  This unit will
also introduce financial statements, and more in-depth discussions about
financial statements will follow in later units.*  
  
 *This unit will also inform you of various government oversights that
are in place to monitor accounting practices.  Throughout this unit, be
sure to focus on the uses of accounting information, including the terms
for generating financial reports.  Also, pay close attention to
accounting reporting rules.  As you can expect, the accuracy of a
company’s financial information is important in making appropriate
economic decisions.*
