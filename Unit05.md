**Unit 5: Inventory Reporting** <span id="5"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn about inventory reporting for
merchandisers and manufacturing firms, and the conventions used in
reporting inventory purchases and sales.  Managing inventory levels is
essential when determining the appropriate amount of each product to
carry in-store or in raw materials to produce finished products.  Large
retailers such as Wal-Mart use “just-in-time” inventory systems that
track store inventory levels as customers purchase items.  You will
learn about how this method of recording inventory can help a company
better regulate its profitability.*  
  
 *As you complete this unit, focus on the differences in inventory
recording for merchandising and manufacturing firms, the cost
conventions for reporting inventory, and how companies handle a decrease
in the value of its current inventory.*
