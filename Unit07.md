**Unit 7: Long-Term Intangible Asset Reporting** <span id="7"></span> 
*In Unit 6, you learned about tangible assets or items that have a
“physical” presence.  Tangible assets, however, are not the only types
of assets that it may hold rights to, or own.  Copyrights, trademarks,
and patents are types of “intangible assets” that are highly valuable
though they cannot be physically held or accessed.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will also learn about mergers, acquisitions, and
goodwill – another type of intangible asset that is also recorded on
financial statements.  For example, a company may pay more than the book
value to acquire another company.  Imagine giving a waiter a 200% tip
for the outstanding service he or she provided.  This is similar to the
concept of goodwill that many companies follow when buying other
companies.  You will learn more about goodwill, why companies extend
this courtesy, and how this transaction is recorded in accordance with
accounting principles.*  
  
 *As you work through this unit, be sure to focus on the difference
between tangible and intangible assets.  Be particularly mindful of the
different ways incremental losses are rectified and recorded on
financial statements.*
