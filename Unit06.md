**Unit 6: Long-Term Tangible Asset Reporting** <span id="6"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn about “tangible assets,” or items that
have a “physical” presence and are either owned or leased by the
company.  Examples of tangible assets include warehouse space, retail
stores, and machinery.  Depending on the type of company, tangible
assets are extremely important to the value of the company and essential
to operations.  Tangible assets are reflected on a company’s financial
statements and must be recorded in a company’s accounting books.*  
  
 *Although assets generally add value to a company, they have the
potential to lose value and are sometimes sold to generate cash.  For
example, when a company sells its machinery and other operational
equipment, the transactions must be properly recorded, because the sales
affect the company’s tangible asset totals.  In this unit, you will
learn the appropriate actions when a loss in value occurs, as well as
the correct way to record the sale of tangible assets in accordance with
the “fundamental accounting equation.”*  
  
 *By the end of this unit, you will be able to identify different types
of long-term tangible assets and how they are recorded on a company’s
financial statements.  As you work through this unit, be sure to pay
close attention to the calculation and recording of depreciation and
tangible asset losses.*
