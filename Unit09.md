**Unit 9: Calculating Financial Ratios** <span id="9"></span> 
*In Unit 3, you learned how to prepare a company’s financial
statements.  In this unit, you will learn to calculate financial ratios
given a company’s financial statements.  As discussed in previous units,
financial statements must be prepared in accordance with accounting
principles.  Analysts often use a company’s financial statements to
determine the growth and viability of a company and then decide if they
want to invest in that company or not.  If every company recorded its
financial transactions and prepared its financial statements
differently, it would be very difficult to calculate meaningful
financial ratios.*  
  
 *Financial statements are analyzed by calculating mathematical
financial ratios using the numerical information in financial
statements.  By calculating financial ratios, investors can determine
the profitability or liquidity of a company without having to set foot
into corporate offices or work in production facilities.  A company’s
profitability and solvency (its ability to meet their financial
obligations) can be calculated from the financial statements.  This unit
serves as a window into the life of a financial analyst, as you learn
important mathematical ratios.  In the next unit, you will delve deeper
into the importance of financial ratios and examine what factors
influence a company’s financial ratios.*  
  
 *As you complete this unit, be sure to focus on how each financial
ratio is calculated and what financial statements are helpful when
calculating each financial ratio.*
