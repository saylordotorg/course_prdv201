**Unit 4: Accounts Receivable Reporting** <span id="4"></span> 
*Suppose you purchase a new 3-D television from a local retailer and
make the purchase on a store-issued credit card.  How does the retailer
record this credit purchase?  As you will learn in this unit, credit
purchases are commonly recorded as accounts receivables.  Accounts
receivables include the money that a company expects to receive in the
future for items purchased today.  Should the money be recorded now or
when it is actually received?  You will explore this question as you
learn the ins-and-outs of accounts receivables.*  
  
 *Companies’ accounts receivables are affected when customers cannot pay
their outstanding balances.  These write-offs have to be carefully
considered when deciding the amount of credit to be issued to each
customer.  With the 2008 recession, many companies had large accounts
receivables write-offs, as customers struggled to pay for
credit-purchased merchandise.  Meanwhile, other companies were able to
use their accounts receivables in negotiating for loans to sustain their
businesses until sales rebounded.*  
  
 *While completing this unit, focus on the components that contribute to
accounts receivables, how write-offs are determined and recorded, and
how companies use their accounts receivables to access loans or generate
cash.*
