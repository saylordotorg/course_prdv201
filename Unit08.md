**Unit 8: Liability Reporting** <span id="8"></span> 
*Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight started the athletic company Nike with an
initial investment of $1,000 in 1972.  Just 40 years later, Nike is the
world’s leader in innovative athletic footwear and apparel, and a
multi-billion dollar corporation with retail stores worldwide and over
30,000 employees.  How do you grow a $1,000 investment into billions of
dollars?  In some cases, the growing company has to take on debt by
securing bank loans or issuing bonds to investors.  Taking on these
liabilities, a company – especially a new company – can secure the cash
it needs to get started or expand its scope.  In this unit, you will
learn about liabilities, why they may be helpful for company operations,
and when they may signal a larger operational problem.  As with managing
personal finances, a company’s ability to meet current financial
obligations is a key factor in maintaining finances and even credit
score points.  Accordingly, you will examine where liabilities are
recorded on financial statements and learn how bonds are priced to
attract more investors.*  
  
 *In this unit, focus on the differences between current and long-term
liabilities, and what they may convey about a company’s ability to meet
debt obligations.  Pay close attention to the way bonds are priced and
what this can mean for the purchaser.*
