Course Syllabus for "PRDV201: Accounting Principles I"
------------------------------------------------------

Though accounting may seem like a dense and complex subject, this course
is designed to present the accounting cycle in an accessible and logical
manner.  This course will provide you with a solid understanding of
basic accounting principles and will introduce you to financial
statement analysis.  Please note that this course is the first of two
courses on the principles of accounting and that each of these two
courses is divided into 10 units.  Each unit should take approximately
three hours to complete and should be completed sequentially for the
most logical progression of information.  As you work through these
units, you will encounter a range of examples and problem sets geared
towards providing you with practical applications of the lessons you
learn.  By the end of this course, you will able to create accurate and
appropriate financial statements to convey a company’s financial health.
This course begins with an introduction to financial accounting and the
various ways in which financial statements allow companies to make
intelligent economic decisions.  All companies, large and small, prepare
financial statements in accordance with specific accounting rules that
investors use to determine which stocks are attractive to buy.
 Accounting principles and financial statements are equally important
for companies that do not have public stock available for investors to
buy.  You will learn all about these statements, the accounting rules
that govern them, and the governing bodies that are responsible for
accounting oversight. Later in the course, you will be immersed in the
details of accounts receivables, inventory, and liabilities. 
Understanding the link among these components is vital to drawing
accurate conclusions about financial statements and making reliable
recommendations for improving profitability. This course concludes with
two units focused on the analyses of financial statements, which will
also introduce several mathematical ratios.  The accurate use of these
ratios is vital to drawing intelligent conclusions about a company’s
operation practices and profitability.  Even billionaire stock investor
Warren Buffet uses financial-statement analysis to determine his next
$100 million stock purchase. The goal of this course is to provide you
with a solid foundation of accounting principles so that you can apply
this knowledge to real-world accounting examples and be able to
comfortably decipher a company’s financial statements and viability.
