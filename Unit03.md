**Unit 3: Constructing Financial Statements** <span id="3"></span> 
*In Unit 2, you learned that financial statements include the balance
sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows, and statement of
shareholder’s equity.  In this unit, you will learn exactly how
financial statements are prepared, using a company’s everyday financial
transactions.  You will also apply the accounting principles learned in
Unit 2 to create a financial statement for a company.  Although all of
these statements are prepared with the same underlying financial
numbers, each statement conveys different information about a company’s
operations and profitability.*  
  
 *Companies like Starbucks, Johnson & Johnson, and Coca-Cola have to
prepare financial statements for their investors and are required to
release these statements publicly.  Imagine the time and attention to
detail that must be taken to prepare these financial statements and the
consequences that may arise if an error is made.  By the end of this
unit, you will have a good understanding of the components of each
financial statement, and you will be able to identify key pieces of
information on each financial statement.*  
  
 *This unit focuses on the key differences between financial statements
and what pieces of data are used in preparing each type.*
