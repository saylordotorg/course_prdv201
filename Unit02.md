**Unit 2: The Accounting Cycle** <span id="2"></span> 
*Suppose you purchase $500 of material for inventory, accept $150 in
payment for merchandise sold, and pay $4,000 in employee wages.  How do
you record these transactions with absolute certainty of what is
available in your company’s account?  In this unit, you will learn about
credits and debits, and how the aforementioned transactions are
appropriately recorded using the accounting rules that you learned in
Unit 1.*  
  
 *Being able to record the everyday financial transactions of a company
is a central part of accounting.  Understanding the accounting cycle,
and how transactions should be recorded, is fundamental in producing
financial statements and making sound judgments about a company’s
financial health.*  
  
 *How are assets recorded?  What about liabilities?  What is equity?
 All of these questions will be answered in this unit, as you learn the
specifics of the “fundamental accounting equation” and work through
real-world examples.*  
  
 *As you navigate this unit, focus on the specifics of recording
financial transactions and what each financial transaction determines,
based on the way it has been recorded.*
