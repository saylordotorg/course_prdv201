**Unit 10: Financial Statement Analysis** <span id="10"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn how to analyze financial statements and
financial ratios.  In the last unit, you examined the information
necessary for calculating financial ratios related to a company’s
profitability, solvency, and liquidity.  Now, you will learn how
investors draw conclusions from these ratios, as well as the factors
that influence a company’s financial ratios.  For example, the ROA of
one technology company may be 10%, whereas the ROA of a similarly sized
technology company may be 25%.  Comparing companies based on company
size or industry is one way for analysts to decipher qualitative
findings in quantitative information.  In this unit, you will learn
about different financial statement analyses and the information that
can be surmised from each method.*  
  
 *Publicly traded companies release financial statements every quarter. 
Once per year these statements may be used by investors to analyze the
current financial profitability and operations of companies within their
investment portfolio.  In some cases, these financial statements can be
the basis for projecting a company’s growth or profitability, based on
past performance.*  
  
 *While working through this unit, be sure to focus on the ways in which
financial ratio values, as well as qualitative data, can be portrayed
with each ratio calculation, and the ways company operations affect
these values.*
